Shiny Apps for eduction/teaching, extension, and research

## Inbreeding

This app takes a pedigree (column 1 = Animal, column 2 = Sire, column 3 = Dam) in .csv format and calculates inbreeding coefficients, number of full/half sibs, and number of offspring for sires and dams. Nice way to get a quick look at your pedigree. Not for large production purposes. It's written in R so it can only handle so much.

## SwineContract

Is an app I wrote to determine profitability of a swine contract through a major producer. It's a smaller version of an app wrote at Iowa State.
